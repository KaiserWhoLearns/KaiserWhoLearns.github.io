Hello! I am a master's student at University of Washington learning natural language processing. My advisors are [Ana Marasoviƒá](https://www.anamarasovic.com/) and [Noah A. Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/).

Since I am still exploring, my interests are nascent. In general, I am interested in natural language processing. Currently, I am inquisitive in **developing novel techniques to facilitate efficient, explainable, robust NLP**. I also want to keep **fairness and biases** in mind when conducting my research. 

I obtained my Bachelor's degrees of computer science (B.S.) and mathematics (B.A.) at University of Washington, too. During my undergraduate years, I worked with [Ana Marasoviƒá](https://www.anamarasovic.com/) on interpretability and [Christopher Hoffman](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~hoffman/) on dual random-walk systems. Thanks a lot to the support of my advisors and my donors, I was able to conduct research and keep learning.

`I have a limited amount of experiences investigating things in life, but if you are having questions on finding SDE/DS internships or applying for master/undergraduate programs and you think I can help, no matter what your background is, please do not hesitate to email me.`

`My hair color and hair style change a lot. Sorry for making people confused - I like trying new look :)`

Cat Warning
======
I have two very cute cats: Bert (white collar with white paws) and Roberta (grey and looks like a little leopard). While you are browsing my website, I hope pictures of Bert and Roberta can make you feel happy and relaxed for a second.
