Hello! I am a PhD student at [JHU CLSP](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/), advised by [Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/).
 
My interests are protean due to my restless curiosity. I am generally interested in understanding how language models function and exploring how we can change them.
Terminologically, I am interested in studying **interpretability (broadly), training dynamics, and reasoning** of language models.

Before my PhD studies, I was a resident at [FAIR Labs](https://ai.facebook.com/research/), working with [Adina Williams](https://ai.facebook.com/people/adina-williams) and [Dieuwke Hupkes](https://dieuwkehupkes.nl/). I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees of computer science (B.S., M.S.) and mathematics (B.A.) with a mnior in classical studies at University of Washington. My advisor was [Noah A. Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/), and I was supervised by [Ana Marasoviƒá](https://www.anamarasovic.com/). During my undergraduate years, I also worked with [Christopher Hoffman](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~hoffman/) on dual random-walk systems. Thanks a lot to the support of my advisors and my donors, I was able to conduct research and keep learning.

`I have a limited amount of life experiences, but if you are having questions and you think I can help, feel free to email me.`

Cat Warning
======
I have two very cute cats: Bert (white collar with white paws) and Roberta (grey and looks like a little leopard). While you are browsing my website, I hope pictures of Bert and Roberta can make you feel happy and relaxed for a second.
