Hello! I am a master's student at University of Washington learning natural language processing. My advisors are [Ana Marasović](https://www.anamarasovic.com/) and [Noah A. Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/).

Since I am still exploring, my interests may change a lot. In general, I am fascinated by natural language processing. Currently, I am inquisitive in **devloping new techniques to facilitate efficient, explanable, and robust systems for NLP**. I also find **bias and fairness** in NLP systems intriguing.

Beginning spring of 2021, I started to pursue the computer science master program at University of Washington. From 2018 to 2021, I obtained my Bachelor's degrees of computer science(B.S.) and mathematics(B.A.) with a minor of classical studies in the same school. During undergraduate years, I worked with Dr. [Ana Marasović](https://www.anamarasovic.com/) on a project about interpretability and Prof. [Christopher Hoffman](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~hoffman/) on a project about dual random-walk systems.

Thanks a lot to the support of my advisors and my donors, I was able to conduct research and keep learning.
