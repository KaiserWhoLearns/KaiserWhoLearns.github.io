I live in Seattle with my patner and two cats, Bert and Roberta. In my free time, I like *photography* (with phone since I am a broken college student), *caligraphy*, *collage art*, and *drawing, painting with colored pencils, watercolor, gouache, as well as oil pastels*.

In this page I placed some of my works that I found enjoyable in the process of drawing.
