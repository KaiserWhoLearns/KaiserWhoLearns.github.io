I live in Seattle with my patner and two cats, Bert and Roberta. In my free time, I like *photography* (with phone since I am a broken college student), *cocktail mixing*, *caligraphy*, *cooking*, and *drawing, painting with colored pencils, watercolor, gouache, as well as oil pastels*.


**[Here](https://kaiserwholearns.github.io/avocations/art) are my drawings.**
