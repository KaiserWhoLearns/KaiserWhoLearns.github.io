The thing I like most is to **create** things and play with different mediums. Many of the items I made or drew are from some video games, shows, or books I love. 


Some 3D prints (model built on my own if not specified).

Many attempts to make "acrylic" pedants, because I do not want to order a large batch of my printed art.
