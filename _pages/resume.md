<!-- Since this question is often asked by admission officers and recruiters, trying my best to avoid a desk rejection, I put an explanation here:

**You only spent three years on your Bachelor's degrees, are they from a four-year-undergraduate program?**

Yes, both of my Bachelor's degrees are from typical four-year-undergraduate programs. The reason why I only spent three years in them is because the undergraduate tuition rate was very high for me (I am an international student) and my master is funded, thus graduating early could free me from the burden of paying for my tuitions. -->
